# Relics of the past

I shall add here snippets of code that I find lying around when I was first learning how to program. 

- 20131205_bfx.py
- 20132811_talib.py

These were trading bots to be used with the now dead Mt Gox and [Goxtool](https://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool). All programmed on a Raspberry Pi too!
